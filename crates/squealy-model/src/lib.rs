//! DDL management engine for squealy.
//!
//! The owned, backend-neutral schema model lives in the core crate (so backends can implement
//! [`SchemaBackend`] against it without depending on this engine). This crate adds the operations
//! over that model: `.sqz` package export/import, and create/script/publish deployment orchestration.
//! Heavier dependencies (KDL, zip) are isolated here, away from the query core.
//!
//! See `docs/ddl-management.md` for the design.
